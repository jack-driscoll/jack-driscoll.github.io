# Ethereal Modern Technologies: 

`"Technology that runs from a backpack on a pissed-off deer in a thunderstorm"`

## Hire me!

[You can hire me at Upwork for monthly service at the starting price of $50/month - less than a single service call!](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01306e2f1473f68c06)  You can have your own "IT guy" on call, with 24-hour turnaround for your SME or even home users!  I do it all!

## Who Are You?

My name is Jack Driscoll (AKA **jackd**/Jack'D/nteleky)  I got my **first computer in 1994** and immediately ran up a $500 bill with AOL that I fervently denied having created. I’ve been using **Linux and FreeBSD since 1999**, when I managed to get them running on an old laptop a parent's friend donated.  Of course, we ran 3.11 on our family desktop - the best Christmas present ever and the only one successfully hidden from my brother.

I’ve installed GUI linux from floppy disks – a full linux system with the X window system was around 14 disks (~20MB).  I’m a FreeBSD enthusiast, I’ve also briefly used NetBSD and OpenBSD, but at a beginner level.  My primary distros are debian/Ubuntu, Mint, antiX, although my knowledge is general enough to be able to offer support for most distributions with a little extra time.

In **2000-2002**, I worked for **Milwaukee PC**, a local computer firm, in retail sales and support.  In **2003-2013** I got my first job (which started as an internship) working for the **Federal Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee**.  We had 3 technicians and supported over **400 users at 22 remote sites**.  From **2014-2017** I worked at **AirRunner**, a WISP (Wireless ISP), where I did absolutely everything except financials and HR.  We had close to **1,000 users in 900 square miles** and I did everything from **CPE installs, Network Engineering, Server/Network Administration, Link Budgeting, Maintenance and Repair, On-Call Support, End User Technical Support**, and probably more I'm not thinking of.  For one month, the only people working there were me and the owner, so I do mean everything.  This was my favorite job, as it made use of all my skills, and they were doing something cutting-edge at the time.  It felt like the wild west sometimes, you never knew what would happen, from getting our e-mail server blacklisted due to spam, Layer-2 Broadcast Storms, looping the network, losing a backhaul link supporting a hundred people and having to drive out to the boonies to climb a 150ft feed mill leg in subzero weather.  I started off knowing almost nothing - I knew linux and I ran OpenWRT on my routers, **in 3 years, I ran the network**.  If I can do that, I can help you.

I always have an eye for emerging technologies and am an **Ethical Hacker**, which means I know how to break things, sneak in, go undetected, and do all sorts of things that "shouldn't work", but do.  It also means I won't steal your credentials or scam you.  I do it because **I find systems fascinating**, and sometimes you learn more by breaking and fixing things than by reading books, by observing and testing than theorizing.  It also means I can do more with less, create solutions that don't exist, and otherwise *conjure what seems like magic from what seems like inanimate systems*.  **I aim to do so much with so little that some day I can do everything with nothing**, but "The First Law of Thermodynamics: It's Not Just A Suggestion, It's The Law".  This means, **I know what the limits are** - not the limits you think exist, but the actual physical limits of the universe, and I will tell you whether something is impossible or just not possible yet or maybe possible but more expensive than a better alternative solution.  It means I want to get all up in that box, to understand it from the inside out, and to tune it like a well-oiled machine.  It also means I know that takes time and money, and **sometimes "good enough" and "now" is better than "perfect" and "never"**.

## What Do You Do?

### IT Support - Linux/Windows

I have managed `a 400 user domain` and `a 1,000 customer Wireless ISP`, I've been working in IT for **over 20 years** and I can handle anything you throw at me (but please be kind).

I offer 3 variations of IT Support - per device, per site, and networking.  I support all variants of **Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD** with some exceptions, but too few to mention.  

**Device Support** means you pay per device, per month, for up to a certain number of calls (which are $50/ea after that).  I will do all the hardware and software support for your **Desktop PC**.

**Site Support** means you pay per site to cover all the **Desktop Computers** at that site.  I will do all the hardware and software support.

**Linux/FreeBSD Support** means you pay per device, per month, for up to a certain number of calls (which are $50/ea after that).  I will do all the hardware and software support.  This is for **Desktops and Servers** but I **must be able to install remote desktop OR have a person on-site**.

**Windows/Other Servers** ask me for a quote.  I don't like working on these, but if you pay me beaucoup bucks I will do *almost anything* within certain moral and ethical guidelines I personally hold.

If you have proprietary software and a support contract I will work with the vendor on your behalf.  If you have proprietary software with no support, I will do what I can but I may not be able to help - this will not count as "a call" in this case.  **If I am ever not able to fix something, it does not count as "a call"** and I will direct you to someone who can assist you, if there is such a person alive on this earth and I can find them, but I'm not a skip tracer (yet).

### Networking Support - Anything

Networking is more expensive because I can't usually remote into your network equipment, although I have my ways of finding ways into networks and devices, if and only if that's something that you give me permission to do.  I'm going to be really up-front about one thing **I don't have any Cisco certs and I probably never will**.  Why?  Because **I've never once in my life wanted to do something with a network that required me to own a piece of Cisco equipment**.  When I worked at the WISP we had a **Cisco ASA** that was the primary firewall.  It was there when I got there and it worked reliably, but I also *never ran into a situation with the ASA I couldn't fix in a couple hours with reading*.  I didn't need to spend thousands in courses and certification that, let's be honest, are going to be barely relevant when you get into the field because the hardware will have changed.  That being said, "A Cisco Guy" could probably run circles around me with their gear, but **that's why I don't charge by the hour, I charge per call**.  It doesn't cost you extra for me to learn on your dime, so while it might take me twice as long, the end result is going to be the same.  If I end up working with you in-depth with Cisco equipment I will learn it inside and out.  

I use my knowledge of **how TCP/IP works in the real world** to inform my decisions and I make good decisions, period.  Call it "Signal Whispering", call it "Black Magic", call it "intuition" - I'm **just that good**, I guarantee it.  If I can't do it, I'll tell you, if I can but it's going to take a long time, I'll tell you.  I won't waste your time, blow smoke up your ass, or lie to you about what I think is possible, **all I ask is for you to be real with me**.  Tell me what you want, what you have, and when you want it done and I'll tell you whether I'm the man for you or whether you should go elsewhere.  I might even recommend someone.  I know what the `TCP/IP` **stack is in linux and how it works** down to *system calls ant the paths packets take through ipfilter*, why bridging is sometimes better than routing (it doesn't have to traverse multiple ipfilter checks), and why VLANs don't make sense for most people (although they make a lot of sense for the right people).

I will work with **any system, from any vendor, any time, under any conditions (but only if you pay me enough)**.  I will attempt to fix your unsupported linux embedded "just works" network doohickey from 2000 and I will have fun doing it.  I love to learn and discover new things, work with new hardware, find new techniques.  I like to find my way around problems and do things people don't think can be done with hardware they didn't think would support it.  If I can't, I'll tell you.  Sometimes it is easier and better to buy Cisco, or a pre-configured "network appliance", especially if you want the support - but if you have me, you don't have to worry, because I am the support.  There's a reason supercomputing clusters run `Linux`.  Did you know that **Juniper Networks' Junos and Cisco's IronPort appliances run** `FreeBSD`?  Did you know that you can run `FreeBSD` on ancient hardware and enjoy **the same rock-solid FreeBSD TCP/IP stack** for *free*?  I'm going to tell you what it costs, though: time.  Getting `FreeBSD` set up is not for the feint of heart, but I've done it more times than I can count.  I've rebuilt world and kernel on running systems.  I've had systems **with years of uptime** that only went down when the power went out and only because **they wouldn't give me the budget for a UPS**.

### Custom Projects

I'm pretty good with **hardware electronics**, I've repaired lots of equipment, made PCBs, engineering DIY solutions.  That being said **I am intermediate level at this**.  I will work with you and I will find a way to do it, but it's going to take more time because I have to learn additional skills and do research I haven't done yet.  I'm very good at R&D and finding custom solutions, but if you want someone to design a PCB and get in manufactured in China, I'm not your guy - but I might know of one.  Tell me what you're thinking and I'll give you my opinion and expertise, no BS.

### Embedded Systems

I have lots of experience with **BusyBox and Embedded Linux**, but Embedded Linux can vary a lot.  Pitch me your project, tell me what strange hardware you've got, or what you want to build, and I'll meet you where you are with where I am - guaranteed, no BS.  If I can only do it with a month of reading, I'll tell you.  If I've already logged hours on the platform, same.

### Anything Else

Man, just ask, I do all sorts of crazy shit, and not to toot my horn, but I'm in the **top 1% of the population** in memory, intelligence, spatial awareness and reasoning, writing and English comprehension.  That being said, I'm not "a dick about it" and I **love teaching as much as I love learning** and doing new things especially if they're crazy things that push the boundaries of what's possible by doing more with less or challenging preconceived notions.  **I will work with you and teach you how to do anything I know how to do, we'll work out a rate!**  I also offer Design, Writing, Voice Work, Storytelling/Mythology and I'm not above keeping you company in a virtual chat session.  ***JUST ASK***

## What are your "credentials"?

In short, I don't have any.  I have **Network+**, the lowliest cert you can get, but I know more than some Senior Network Engineers about what really works and I can do some things they've never even considered trying.  I know for sure I can do more with less.  I have ***over 15 years of professional IT Experience*** - see "Who are you?".  More important than that, however, **I'm a self-taught learner with good troubleshooting skills and intuition who never gives up**.
