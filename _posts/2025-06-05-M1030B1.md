# M1030B1

I have an M1030B1, the USMC version of the Kawasaki KLR650.  I call him Dex.  It's a blast, and *the only blasts I get these days*!  No, it's not a diesel, the diesel is the M1030M1, however, as cool as they are, given their rarity, maintenance would be a huge concern.  They're also really expensive when they do come up for sale.  **I'm looking for other on/off road motorcycle enthusiasts in WI.**  If this is you, [contact me](#contact).

I gained possession of this stunning craft in **2023** after lusting about it for about 10 years when I found out about the diesel.  I found it on craigslist during a random search for a Kawasaki KLR.  After driving *4 hours* to come see it, I was exhausted.  It looked good, but it was my first bike (though I'd ridden dirtbikes as a teenager with my cousins).  I decided to sleep on it, and the next day I called the guy.  We'd agreed on $2300 and I struggled to get it together, but I did.  When I asked if we were good for $2300, he said, "no, I've always been at $2700".  I didn't have an extra $400, nor did I like being "leveraged" like this.  No wonder it had been listed for months.  He refused to sell for our agreed upon price.

A month later, I'd come up with the funds and called him.  Couldn't sell it -- had it up for auction.  I was mortified when it jumped to $1700 the first day, but figured I had an upper hand, having had inspected it already and I would find out what it was really worth.  Thankfully, GOD looked kindly upon me, and I ended up *winning it* for *$2100*, even less than my initial offer.  Greed doesn't always pay off, kiddos.
