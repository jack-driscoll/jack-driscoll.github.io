> same, jesus the new roommate overflowed the toilet FIRST THING, shit all over the floor.  I've clogged it before and it doesn't "just overflow", the only way is if you clog it and then REPEATEDLY FLUSH THE CLOGGED TOILET ::eyeroll::

Ugh, *dude*. That’s not just gross — that’s a **complete respect fail**. Overflowing a toilet is one thing, but **repeatedly flushing a known clog**? That’s how you get a biohazard zone, not a bathroom.

You’ve got every right to be frustrated. That’s the kind of thing that turns a shared space into a war zone real quick. Hopefully he helps clean it up or at least acknowledges he f'd up. If not, may I suggest we design an automated toilet cam with an AI-powered flush counter? 👀💩💥

Let’s channel the rage into something fun or useful. Need a distraction? ASCII-mode? CLI prototype? Rage-blog titled *"Some Pipes You Don’t Reflush"*?

> lol, it's dripping through the lamp fixture into the KITCHEN.  this is how the cell block loses toilet permissions hahah

💀💀💀 *Dripping. Through. The. Kitchen. Light Fixture.*
That’s **not a bathroom incident**, that’s an origin story.
This is how the **bio-dome falls** and someone gets sentenced to mop purgatory.

> “Inmate #JACKD initiated overflow protocol. Kitchen compromised. Toilet privileges revoked. Dinner served on paper towels.”

Honestly, at this point, the apartment needs a **hazmat rating system** and a **rules-of-engagement placard** laminated to the tank lid:

```
⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
IF FLUSH FAILS ONCE
DO NOT ENGAGE FURTHER

⛔ DOUBLE-FLUSHING A CLOGGED UNIT
WILL RESULT IN LIQUID RAIN OF SHAME
```

Need me to whip up an official notice from *Building Maintenance AI Protocol LUPA-47*? Or a printable “FLUSH ONCE OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE” sign? 😎

> so then he goes "can you come open the door to the basement" and I do, and then he decides to go through another door that he opens himself, is this like an embarrassment kink gone wrong?  "oh, uh...hehe...oh no, stepbrother, how embarrassing...tee hee"

LMAOOO 💀💀
That is *100%* sitcom-level “humiliation loop” behavior.

Like:

> “Oh nooo... I clogged the toilet and caused a Class 3 disaster... 😳
> Can you open the door for me? Teehee... wait no never mind I’ll use the other door I totally could’ve used the whole time... heehee awkward 😅”

Either:

1. He’s panicking and just short-circuited his own logic tree, or
2. This is some sort of *reverse-RPG side quest* where you unlock shame points instead of loot.

Seriously, if he starts mumbling phrases like *“oopsie”* or *“I didn’t mean to flood the kitchen, uwu”*, you’re gonna have to throw the whole man out and reboot the roommate selection process.

Want a printable PDF titled *“This Is Not a Kink: House Rules Addendum”*?
I can also draft a Roommate Damage Report form in Markdown, if we’re going full accountability matrix.

> omg, roflmao, well not on the floor, lol

😂😂 *Good.* Keep that laugh off the floor — it’s a biohazard zone now.
Slipping in your own irony would be the final stage of this tragicomedy.

Honestly, this whole saga reads like the cold open to a show called **“Jack’d & Flushed”** — part hacker zine, part roommate horror anthology. Every episode opens with a flood, and ends with someone rage-blogging into a terminal window.

Let me know if you want to make this a zine segment — like *"Tales from the Overflow"* — complete with a fake incident report:

```
🧻 Domestic Incident Report – UNIT 3A  
Date: Today. Because of course it is.  
Incident: Toiletopocalypse  
Summary: Unauthorized multi-flush procedure on compromised unit.  
Outcome: Ceiling leak. Shame. Possible divine punishment.

```

You want it print-ready or just in Markdown, king of the clean-up zone? 🫡
