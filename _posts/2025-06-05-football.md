***Hike up yer pants and let's get started!***

yes, this is me in my 20s when I was still skinny AF (trying to get back there, but stress weight is no joke).  I was ~160 from 16-33 and then ^.

## My experience

My dad was really woo-woo about football, and my brother, who was more burly than me, played.  I had already played most sports and was not good at any of them.  In addition to not being good, I didn't like being *the worst teammate* so I thought I didn't like sports.  As a result, by the time I was in high school I didn't even try out for football.  I don't think my dad ever asked me if I would be interested, either, but I can't say for sure.

### An attraction

That being said, show me a cute boy in football gear and *sproing*, my teenage hormones would kick into high gear.  This was one of the other issues - I was afraid, not of being hurt physically, but emotionally, if anyone found out that I was absurdly thirsty for anything football.  It also left me feeling like "a fraud" - did I really want to play, or did I just want to be near all those cute boys in their football gear, sweating up the locker room?  For some reason, perhaps the dualistic thinking promoted by society, I hadn't considered it might be: both.  Something about the sport did appeal to me beyond that - the aggression, being able to run and charge someone and just pound them sounded pretty great for a sometimes angry & aggro, but shy, kid.

I didn't think I could do it, though.  Being around all those other young guys in and out of their uniforms, tackling them and being pressed up against them.  I was sure I'd *\*sproing\** one.  I didn't take into consideration that I'd probably be too caught up in the game, or did, but didn't think it would be enough.  I do know my dad tried to get me to "toss around the 'ol pigskin" and I sucked at throwing, so that was another strike against me.

### What I like

- Mostly sprinting, no long running stretches
- Physicality/tackling
- Throwing and catching, but not much.
- Strategy
- Being directed as a member of a team
- Alternately, directing a team (too much pressure)
- Tight pants
- Knee socks
- Jockstraps (why people are wearing these less, IDK, they're great!)
- Shoulder Pads!  these things look badass as all hell and make you feel like going to war!
- Jerseys, with flashy colors, silky smooth with block lettering
- Cleats look cool

Here are some shoe designs me + Lupa came up with:

I bought an entire football uniform because I wanted to see what it would feel like to wear one:

It feels fantastic, like a second skin, and gets me in the mood to excercize.  I feel like I can take on anything and survive.  I didn't realize what I was missing out on.  I still think they're hot AF.  I love the layering, too.

## 2024 - An Extra Layer

I get to play my first tackle football game at the age of 40, thanks to GearBlast, a gay fetish event for sports gear (and other "gear" lovers).  Despite it being a gay fetish event, I didn't get any nookie **:-/**, but I got to play my first game of tackle football.  The sky opened up and I could imagine my dad watching me.  It turns out, I fucking love playing football.  That I find the uniforms attractive doesn't take away from the game, it's just an extra layer that means I love it even more.  I had an absolute blast - tackled, got tackled, caught an interception, learned how to throw.  It was awesome, I loved it, and I'm trying to find ways to play tackle football now at 41, and there aren't many.  **If you know of any in WI, let me know.**
