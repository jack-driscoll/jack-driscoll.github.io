description: "BLASTED: The Energy Drink That Builds You A New Brain.  Why get BLASTED?  It has theobromine, the vasodilating cousin of caffeine.  It balances the vasoconstricting effects of caffeine.  It's filled with 5 GRAMS of supplements.  Most energy drinks have laughable amounts of "active ingredients", but we have functional doses.  If you don't feel it, I'll give you your money back (once)."

# BLASTED: BUILD A NEW BRAIN

How can I say that you'll build a new brain?  Well, for starters, BLASTED is filled with all of the essential amino acids that your body uses to construct neurotransmitters, cells and tissues.  It has literally everything your body actually *needs* - because it can't manufacture these essential building blocks.  It also has a number of herbs that affect neuroplasticity and brain growth factor.

## But I don't want to get all tweaked

You won't!  We also have ashwandaga, which regulates the hypothalamic system, reducing your stress and keeping you calm.

## I'm depressed

It has everything your body needs to build and deploy serotonin, too!  And dopamine, norepinephrine, and everything else, literally.

## What's in it?

I'm not posting the entire formula yet, but it involves 11 substances and 5g of ingredients for a "standard" drink.  I have a proprietary method of putting Omega-3 Fatty Acids (from algae) into the drink without ruining the flavor and retaining shelf life.

Help me make it! Email blasted a@t ethertech.org, sign an NDA and I'll tell you *everything*.
