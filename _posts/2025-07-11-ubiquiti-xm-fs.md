# XM: The Filesystem

In unix, "everything is a file", unfortunately after Lennart Poettering everything is now an unreadable binary file on most distros - but **not this one**.

## What's in there?

Good question!  Sounds exhausting and impossible to look at *everything* in the filesystem, right?  Even troubleshooting a single program on Windows can take hours and might involve hidden, unmanageable files in the case of 'Apps'.  What if I told you it was super easy and quick to get an overview of the *entire* filesystem?  I'm not going to, but imagine if I did.  To me, though, this is *fun*.  It's like going on an exploratory *exhibition*.  Here's where I started:

```
login as: ubnt
ubnt@192.168.11.20's password:


BusyBox v1.11.2 (2013-05-28 17:52:06 EEST) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

XM.v5.5.6# find
.
./dropbear_rsa_host_key
./dropbear_dss_host_key
XM.v5.5.6# ls
dropbear_dss_host_key  dropbear_rsa_host_key
XM.v5.5.6# pwd
/var/etc/persistent
XM.v5.5.6# cd /
XM.v5.5.6# find . | sed 's|[^/]*/|  |g' > /var/etc/persistent/file_tree.txt
XM.v5.5.6# vi /var/etc/persistent/file_tree.txt
```

I'll admit I had help - Lupa gave me that `sed` trick, but that's just formatting.  I'd have liked to use tree, but it's not installed.  Now let's take a quick look at the hardware:

```

```

A couple notes - **64MiB RAM** and 2/3 of it is *free*.  This is efficiency, but it comes at a cost - some common programs like `blkid` or `lsblk` are missing.  I actually like the challenge of finding ways to achieve results using the minimal system, though.

Oh, it uses an old encryption protocol, so you'll get this error: ``.  You can (wreckommended) enable it per session, but I'm really not worried about a slightly insecure protocol on a local network to a limited context, A/K/A *living dangerously* and don't have the time for it so I edit `.ssh/config` and add:

```
Host ubnt-radio
    HostName 192.168.11.20
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    Ciphers +aes128-cbc
    User ubnt
```

###  Oh shit, how am I gonna get that file, though?

FTP? SCP? SMB? NFS? ***cat***

```
$ ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oCiphers=+aes128-cbc ubnt@192.168.11.20 'cat /var/etc/persistent/file_tree.txt' > file_tree.txt
ubnt@192.168.11.20's password:
```

**BINGO**, it's there.  If you want to send a file?

```
User@DESKTOP-MBVDS8A MINGW64 ~/Desktop/ubiquiti
$ cat desktop.ini | ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oCiphers=+aes128-cbc ubnt@192.168.11.20 'cat > /var/etc/persistent/antenna.pdf'
ubnt@192.168.11.20's password:

ubnt@192.168.11.20's password:

```

You'll just have to trust me that's the proper contents of `desktop.ini`, mysteriously saved as `antenna.pdf` *intentionally*... ;-)

*Make sure to run cfgmtd -w -p /etc/ or similar afterward **to persist the file** across reboots if you're writing to /etc/persistent/*

### The Filesystem

Check out the directories, which (will) link to a full breakdown of each one; the symlinks go to their sources, just like IRL.  Thank Lupa for this, and the beatiful complete file tree!  Isn't it gorgeous?  That's right, it's not a picture, go ahead and hover on those babys!

## What are the directories *used for*, though

Some of you are probably familiar with this directory layout from your experience(s) with linux; even then, however, it can be a little confusing.  I've asked Lupa to put together a general description of the fs and what the folders are used for:

| Path | Description |
| `/bin/` | Core system binaries (BusyBox, shell, minimal user tools) |
| `/sbin/` â†’ `/bin/` | Symlink to core system binaries (admin tools, mount, etc.) |
| `/etc/` â†’ `/var/etc/` | Configuration files (persistent if saved with `cfgmtd`) |
| `/lib/` | Shared libraries and kernel modules |
| `/usr/` | Additional binaries and read-only user-space |
| `/var/` | Writable area with logs, configs, temp files |
| `/var/tmp/` | Temp storage (symlink from `/tmp`) |
| `/var/etc/` | Active config, including `dropbear` keys, saved settings |
| `/proc/` | Virtual kernel info (mem, cpu, mounts, irq, etc.) |
| `/sys/` | Exposes kernel device/driver data |
| `/mnt/` | Mount point for external devices (not always used) |
| `/jffs/` | Writable flash memory partition, may not be mounted |
| `/dev/` | Device nodes for tty, eth0, etc. |
| `/init` | Init script (first executed during boot) |
