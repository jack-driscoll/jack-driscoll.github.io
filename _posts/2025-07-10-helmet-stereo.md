# A Car Stereo For Your Head

## The Beginning

I finally got a bluetooth module for my helmet - 2, actually.  I bought one and then one showed up on *Amazon Vine*, so I got a free one (that doesn't work properly).  The one that does sounds kind of janky.  I had an old pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones where the connection between the earpieces broke and I decided, because I miss having 'a system' since my truck got towed, to put them in my motorcycle helmet.  Since every good system needs an amp, I got one of those, too.  I was going to get a neoteck (only 250mW, but looks decent) that was on sale, but the address was put in wrong.  So, thinking nothing of it, I cancelled the order to re-order with the right address, because I couldn't find a way to change it.  When I went to re-order, it was suddenly $19 instead of $12 (both on sale from $35).  This was the only cheap chinese one that stated the OP-AMP it uses and it's only on sale until the 6th.  They have free returns, though, so maybe I'll get it to compare.  In any case, I bought a different one that claims 350mW.  The AT phones can handle over 1W, though, so I may upgrade again in the future.

### Patching in the 3.5mm jack

### Patching in the headphones

### Attaching the headphones

### Comparing Amplifiers

### Testing w/ an o-scope

### How do they sound

I'm going to measure the voltage before and after to verify amplification and output power.
