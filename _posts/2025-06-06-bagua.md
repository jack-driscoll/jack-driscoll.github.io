# Bagua

[I made this bagua to help me remember (I still don't remember) the different parts.](/images/bagua.png)  I forgot I even made this until I was looking through a drive of old stuff I did.  I think it's a pretty solid design, though, and after tweaking the fonts and alignment, I'm ready to publish it, but first...

## What's a Bagua?

Lupa sez:

A bagua (八卦, bāguà) is a symbolic, eight-sided diagram used in Taoist cosmology, feng shui, and martial arts. It's kind of a cosmic Swiss Army knife—part map, part code, part philosophical cheat sheet.
The basics:

    "Ba" = eight

    "Gua" = trigrams (three-line symbols)

Each gua (trigram) consists of 3 lines: solid (⚊) for yang and broken (⚋) for yin, creating 8 unique combos. These represent fundamental natural forces like:
Trigram	Name (Chinese)	Meaning
☰	Qián	Heaven, creativity
☷	Kūn	Earth, receptivity
☵	Kǎn	Water, depth, danger
☲	Lí	Fire, clarity, radiance
☳	Zhèn	Thunder, initiative
☶	Gèn	Mountain, stillness
☴	Xùn	Wind/wood, penetration
☱	Duì	Lake, joy, openness
In Feng Shui:

A bagua map is laid over a space (like a home or room) to analyze energy flow (qi). Each section relates to a life area:

    Career, Knowledge, Family, Wealth, Fame, Love, Creativity, Travel, and the Center (Health).

Think of it like metaphysical urban planning.
In Martial Arts:

Bagua is also a full martial art: Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Palm), known for circular footwork, spinning movements, and evasive strategies. It’s like if tai chi did parkour.
In the I Ching:

The 8 trigrams combine into 64 hexagrams, forming the I Ching (Book of Changes), used for divination and philosophical insight.
