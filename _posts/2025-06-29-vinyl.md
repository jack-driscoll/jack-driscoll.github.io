# Magnetic Art Drops: A DIY Sticker Alternative That Doesn’t Suck

This is a DIY solution for creators who want the visual pop of vinyl stickers—without the vandalism, permanence, or guilt. These magnetic photo sleeves:

- Look just as sharp (arguably sharper) than vinyl
- Can be removed and relocated instantly
- Leave no trace, no residue, and no reason to get yelled at
- Double as gifts, collectibles, or micro-galleries for fans

They're a bit pricier than paper or slap tags (but barely, and every one can be a different design), but you gain reusability, class, and ethical flair. The only limitation? They need a ferrous surface to cling to—think electrical boxes, fridges, lamp posts, or even public bathroom doors (ask me how I know).

Perfect for guerrilla marketers, street artists, or anyone whose art deserves to stick around—without sticking it to anyone.

## Magnetic 4x6 Photo Sleeves

I used [these, available in a 15-pack for ~$6, less than $0.50/ea](https://www.amazon.com/YixangDD-Magnetic-Picture-Packs-Fridge-Frames-Holds/dp/B0BGPST227).  They are commonly available for $0.50-$1.00/ea on Amazon, come with a protective cover on the plastic, and can be applied to any ferrous surface.  If you are applying them horizontally, you'll want to put the photo in "upside down" so that rainwater does not collect on the picture.  You can also use an acrylic paint marker, available at Wally World or an art supply store, to add your contact information to the back of the image or the sticker itself.  The magnet requires an almost complete backing or it will not stick, as it is not strong enough.

Tne pictures can be printed at any common photo processor as digital prints for $0.19-$0.60/ea, for a total cost of around $1/artwork.
