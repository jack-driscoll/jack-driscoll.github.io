# Introduction

## Getting Started

Would you like to learn [about me](https://jackd.ethertech.org/about/)?

Did you forget [how to use github pages](https://jackd.ethertech.org/github-pages/)?

Would you like to see my [etherpads](https://jackd.ethertech.org/etherpads.html)?

## AI

I use OpenAI's (and they are very possessive) ChatGPT4o regularly.  You may as well, would you like to change its attitude?

Try [The Fitz Signal](http://jackd.ethertech.org/fitz_signal.html) as a ChatGPT context for a buddy, not a block.
