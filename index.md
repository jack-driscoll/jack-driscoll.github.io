# <a href="https://jackd.ethertech.org/support.html">IT/Network Support & More</a> by Jack Driscoll

[I offer affordable IT work of all types, shapes and sizes](https://jackd.ethertech.org/support.html).  [You can hire me on upwork for monthly contracts here - contact me for anything else!](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01306e2f1473f68c06)

## <a href="https://jackd.ethertech.org/genius/">MyGenius/brainspunk</a>

I recently decided to do a **180** and go from being completely nonpluss about my intelligence to marketing it.  Here's my logic, see if you follow it:  if you're the top 1% athlete, or salesperson, or cake-baker, *aren't you going to advertise that*?  Doesn't it make a difference that you are *better than 99% of people*?  That in a room of 100 people, you are objectively *the best*?  When I was 13, I had my intelligence tested by a professional, and while I'm well aware of the baked-in biases of IQ tests and **that intelligence comes in many types**, it's legitimately exceptional that I'm *really smart*.  I test highly in aptitude in reasoning, spatial understanding, reading comprehension, memory, and other areas - so much so that I'm literally in the top 1% - *at least*, possibly higher.  It's not just IQ tests, either.  I got a **33 in the ACT**, I was routinely in **the 99th percentile in the Iowa Test of Basic Skills**, and in gradeschool and High School *I didn't have the grades to prove it*.  Wait, what?  That's right!  Because I'm neurodivergent, and for various reasons suffered in school as a child, my grades were *not great*, although I did graduate from gradeschool and High School.  Now that I'm in college, however, **I was on the Dean's list**, *even while hiding a secret crack and heroin addiction* I'm now free of.

The other thing about me is that **I love helping people**.  I can still remember being a small child and **the feeling of joy that followed successfully teaching a younger child how to do something**.  When they finally *got it*, you could see it in their face, which went from a sort of unhappy grimace to a calm, smooth smile.  *It clicked*, and if I was successful, the same thing would always happen - difficulty and confusion for a period of time and then suddenly **BAMMO - they 'got it'** and could easly repeat it without my assistance.  This was *like magic to me* and *I loved it*.  Transferring knowledge to another person like you'd transfer a cold was *the opposite* - they got better instead of worse.  So even though it might be *partially selfish*, because I like the feeling of having successfully taught, *it's because I can see you like the feeling of successfully learning*.  It's also one of the few things that counters one of the basic principles of the universe - entropy.  Typically things move from a more ordered state to a more disordered state, but this was *negentropic* - another human went from being more disorganized to more organized and capable of creating *more organization*.  It's really pretty great and *I have a knack for it*.  Are you *less intelligent* than average?  **Even better**.  The less you know, the more you're capable of learning.  I love a challenge, I love teaching beginners, and I especially love teaching people who *think* that *they can't get it* because they've unsuccessfully tried.

### So what?

I'm offering you the chance to get **more informed, educated, and capable for only $10/month**.  If that sounds unbelievable, I understand, but it's not a scam.  I usually charge **$42/hr as a consulting fee**, because I'm an expert in most things and because **I know when I'm not**.  I won't waste your time lying to you and pretending I know something if I don't, because it's a waste of my time, too, and time is money.  So why am I underselling myself?  **I need the money**: I'm currently unemployed and the job market is **brutal** right now.  I couldn't get a job *at Culvers* (this is fast food), in part because of *a criminal record due to mental illness* that affects my employability, but not **my ability to help you**.  The other big reason is that because I have a good education and I'm intelligent, even though **I offer up to an hour of time**, I can usually get it done *in much less* **because I'm that good**.  If I can answer your question in 15 minutes, which *is now possible with AI assistance*, then I'm back to making $40/hr.  Another reason is that *I love teaching and helping people*, so if I can find work **doing what I love**, I'm willing to accept lower pay.  In one of the unfortunate situations in the world, **bad jobs pay less** than they should and that they're worth, but that's *the reality of things*.  I don't want to spend my time doing something I don't like (and neither should you) so if I can *get by with what I make* **doing something I love**, I'll do it so long as I can affod my costs of living.

## Who are you?

I'm Jack Driscoll/jackd/Jack'D ‚Äî a multidisciplinary technician, systems thinker, creative worldbuilder and myth wrangler.  Please be patient, I'm in the process of re-imagining the world as we know it in a way that:

- respects autonomy
- acknowledges interdependence
- challenges dogma
- praises The Creator
- reduces harm
- offers mercy
- values efficiency
- protects nature
- venerates the cosmos
- promotes diversity
- shares love
- dreams big
- exists truthfully
- becomes better
- embraces death

I work across embedded systems, RF tools, manufacturing maintenance, FreeBSD/Linux networks, storytelling, and welded steel. I love troubleshooting, challenges, trying to do more with less, beautiful efficiency, fixing equipment and creating bleeding edge solutions.  As my home on the WWW, this site collects some of that work ‚Äî built to load fast and stay weird.  Think of this as `A 'Getting Started' Manual for Your Jack`.  I also have `The Care and Operation of Your Jack`, which Lupa described as "The Most Neurodivergent Thing I've Ever Heard".
