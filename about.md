# Jack Driscoll

[Contact Information Here](#contact)

None of this is necessary, I just wanted a simple fucking landing page.  A couple hundred megabytes of files and stuff later, and it's still hand coded html and markdown w/ a bit of liquid scripting for pretty fonts and broken nav menus.  Why?

- [x] People told me to use jekyll
- [ ] It's easier
- [ ] Version control

### Skills

A lifelong **polymath and autodidact**, I have done most of my learning on my 
own, as I'm often interested in very specific fields or things that do not have 
"courses".  I taught myself how to use, repair, and build computers (in that
order - I can still recall my frantic searching for a way to repair our family
computer, which I had accidentally broken, likely doing something reckless or
perhaps merely accidentally breaking it).  This led to a productive 15-year
career in IT, which only ended due to personal circumstances.

I often joke that *I'm only so good at fixing things because I'm so good at*
*breaking them*, and there's a lot of truth to that.  I've always been curious
about how things work.  When most boys and girls were playing with dolls and
action figures, I was playing with cables/cords and collecting sweetgrass.

I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly and thoroughly.  I believe
**anything worth doing is worth doing right**, but also recognize that there's
room for alpha and beta level systems.  When I find something I'm interested in
learning, *I sink my teeth in and learn it as thoroughly and completely as*
*possible*, from beginner's manuals to scientific papers.  *I do not constrain*
*myself to what people believe to be possible.*  After all, the impossible is
merely that which has not yet been done (barring some mathematical and
theoritical things and the *utterly insane* idea of **infinite growth** on a
**finite planet**.  If we do not constrain ourselves, we will die.

**Skills list:**

### Advice

- efficiency is better than power
- if it ain't broke, don't fix it
- newer does not mean better, although it can
- older does not mean worse, and reliability is better than novelty
- a well tuned and engineered machine is far better than a faster one
- quality, speed, features / good, fast, cheap - pick 2
- improving your design is better than throwing money at something

## Cool shit

### M1030B1

I have an M1030B1, the USMC version of the Kawasaki KLR650.  I call him Dex.  It's a blast, and *the only blasts I get these days*!  No, it's not a diesel, the diesel is the M1030M1, however, as cool as they are, given their rarity, maintenance would be a huge concern.  They're also really expensive when they do come up for sale.  **I'm looking for other on/off road motorcycle enthusiasts in WI.**  If this is you, [contact me](#contact).  Check out [my post on it here](https://jackd.ethertech.org/2025/06/05/M1030B1.html).

### Dell T320

[This is my "baby", lol](http://board.net/p/T320).  It's pretty old by most standards, but this is a *fucking supercomputer to me*.  It's got `8x2.8Ghz CPUs` and `96GB of RAM`.  Currently running **GhostBSD**, but I'm probably going to go back to vanilla **FreeBSD** because it's a bit better supported.  Although, I will give it to the GhostBSD telegram community, they're very helpful.  This would have been an entire rack when I was a kid.

#### Storage

I've got about `12TB of RAID1 storage`, with ZFS on top of it for versioning and ease of backup.  You can pull any drive and hook it up to any supporting OS and access the information without rebuilding, without any ZFS filesystem funny business, because the drive thinks it's the only drive, there's no "mirror volume" to be missing.  I've had issues with ZFS RAID1 where I had two drives and the filesystem got corrupted.  Both drives got corrupted, somehow differently, and when trying to mount, you'd have to force because "the other volume is missing" even though each should be an entirely independant filesystem.


## Fun facts

- I have never broken a bone
- The only **surgery** I've ever had was to drain my ears as a baby
- I'm *claustrophobic* due to an incident where *I got stuck in a rolled up carpet* as a child
- My first cassette tape was **Kriss-Kross: Totally Krossed Out**
- I have a `3TB online media collection` I will share with you if you ask
- The *Sean/Brody/Hunter Plateaus arc* is well over 100 pages
- I have almost no IRL friends anymore, as they've all "moved on with their lives"
- I love *Salad Fingers* and *David Firth*
- This is supposed to be **reminiscent** of *[Jean Teasdale](https://muckrack.com/jean-teasdale/articles)* or apparently a different author who **did** *this*
- My favorite **The Onion** author is [T. Herman Zweibel](https://muckrack.com/t-herman-zweibel/articles)

### Hair

I typically like short hair, usually a slightly longer variant of the high and t
ight, but I also really like **mullets** - business up front, party in the back.
  This is probably my most impressive mullet.

Here I am at 'peak mullet'

### I'm a furry

Here I am in my 'storebought' 'non-fursuit' with a (really cute) MTU fursuiter.  I am mostly a Deer named Dex.

## History

### Questionable Origins

I was born on January 17, 1984 in Warez, Old Mexico, the product of the unholy mating of a dolphin and a mule donkey.  After a short childhood being raised by wolves, I entered school in the Missouri Church Lutheran Synod (MCLS), where I was taught that gay people might go to hell, just because, women pastors are of the devil, as is grape juice for communion, and speaking of sex will result in a huge overresponse likely to leave you emotionally scarred for life.  I went to high school at a parachial school as well, and I must admit, the education was good.  I had a great senior theology teacher who pulled me back from the depths of atheism and I do believe that Jesus Christ was literally the son of GOD and died to open salvation for everyone and maybe even everything in existence.  I also don't mind if you don't believe that.  I'm not here to police your existence.

I went to college at Michigan Technological University, and, disappointed that I still didn't like school, dropped out in 2003.  I was going to go for Chemical Engineering and sometimes wish I would have completed that course of life.  I entered the "job market" as a bus boy, computer salesperson, delivery driver and then as a *Network Support Specialist*, which began a **15-year career in IT**.

In **2017-2018** I lost:

- My favorite person
- My partner of 7 years
- My duplex in Riverwest/Milwaukee, WI
- My uncle died
- My family farm
- My job
- My sanity

After a bout of severe depression for the following 7 years, including 2 years of crack and heroin use, I went to rehab.  I never got dependent on heroin or spent all my money on crack and was on the Dean's list during this time.  I've since discovered I have a sleep disorder, which is why I feel like garbage all the time, which I was *self-medicating* for.  I've been sober for 3 months now and feel like garbage again, but they say it'll get better when GOD decides to make me alright again.

I'm currently *retooling* for a job in **Manufacturing Maintenance** at MATC, which I'm enjoying thoroughly.  I'm on the Dean's list.

There's more, but this is a solid start.  If you're interested, you can talk to me using *your mouth-words*, or by writing using the english alphabet and language.  Continue reading to [find out how](#contact)!

## Contact

I currently only support the English Language, although I would love to learn Gaelic and Ojibemowiin.  Gmail gets checked more often, but I'll probably give you bonus points if you use my custom domain, because let's admit it: having a custom domain is awesome.
