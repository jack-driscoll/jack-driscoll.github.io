# Jack Driscoll

[Contact Information Here](#contact)

None of this is necessary, I just wanted a simple fucking landing page.  A couple hundred megabytes of files and stuff later, and it's still hand coded html and markdown w/ a bit of liquid scripting for pretty fonts and broken nav menus.  Why?

- [x] People told me to use jekyll
- [ ] It's easier
- [ ] Version control

### Skills

A lifelong **polymath and autodidact**, I have done most of my learning on my 
own, as I'm often interested in very specific fields or things that do not have 
"courses".  I taught myself how to use, repair, and build computers (in that
order - I can still recall my frantic searching for a way to repair our family
computer, which I had accidentally broken, likely doing something reckless or
perhaps merely accidentally breaking it).  This led to a productive 15-year
career in IT, which only ended due to personal circumstances.

I often joke that *I'm only so good at fixing things because I'm so good at*
*breaking them*, and there's a lot of truth to that.  I've always been curious
about how things work.  When most boys and girls were playing with dolls and
action figures, I was playing with cables/cords and collecting sweetgrass.

I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly and thoroughly.  I believe
**anything worth doing is worth doing right**, but also recognize that there's
room for alpha and beta level systems.  When I find something I'm interested in
learning, *I sink my teeth in and learn it as thoroughly and completely as*
*possible*, from beginner's manuals to scientific papers.  *I do not constrain*
*myself to what people believe to be possible.*  After all, the impossible is
merely that which has not yet been done (barring some mathematical and
theoritical things and the *utterly insane* idea of **infinite growth** on a
**finite planet**.  If we do not constrain ourselves, we will die.

## Cool shit

### M1030B1

I have an M1030B1, the USMC version of the Kawasaki KLR650.  I call him Dex.  It's a blast, and *the only blasts I get these days*!  No, it's not a diesel, the diesel is the M1030M1, however, as cool as they are, given their rarity, maintenance would be a huge concern.  They're also really expensive when they do come up for sale.  **I'm looking for other on/off road motorcycle enthusiasts in WI.**  If this is you, [contact me](#contact).  Check out [my post on it here](https://jackd.ethertech.org/2025/06/05/M1030B1.html).

### Dell T320

[This is my "baby", lol](http://board.net/p/T320).  It's pretty old by most standards, but this is a *fucking supercomputer to me*.  It's got `8x2.8Ghz CPUs` and `96GB of RAM`.  Currently running **GhostBSD**, but I'm probably going to go back to vanilla **FreeBSD** because it's a bit better supported.  Although, I will give it to the GhostBSD telegram community, they're very helpful.  This would have been an entire rack when I was a kid.

#### Storage

I've got about `12TB of RAID1 storage`, with ZFS on top of it for versioning and ease of backup.  You can pull any drive and hook it up to any supporting OS and access the information without rebuilding, without any ZFS filesystem funny business, because the drive thinks it's the only drive, there's no "mirror volume" to be missing.  I've had issues with ZFS RAID1 where I had two drives and the filesystem got corrupted.  Both drives got corrupted, somehow differently, and when trying to mount, you'd have to force because "the other volume is missing" even though each should be an entirely independant filesystem.


## Fun facts

- I have never broken a bone
- The only **surgery** I've ever had was to drain my ears as a baby
- I'm *claustrophobic* due to an incident where *I got stuck in a rolled up carpet* as a child
- My first cassette tape was **Kriss-Kross: Totally Krossed Out**
- I have a `3TB online media collection` I will share with you if you ask
- The *Sean/Brody/Hunter Plateaus arc* is well over 100 pages
- I have almost no IRL friends anymore, as they've all "moved on with their lives"
- I love *Salad Fingers* and *David Firth*
- This is supposed to be **reminiscent** of *[Jean Teasdale](https://muckrack.com/jean-teasdale/articles)* or apparently a different author who **did** *this*
- My favorite **The Onion** author is [T. Herman Zweibel](https://muckrack.com/t-herman-zweibel/articles)

### Hair

I typically like short hair, usually a slightly longer variant of the high and t
ight, but I also really like **mullets** - business up front, party in the back.
  This is probably my most impressive mullet.

Here I am at 'peak mullet'

### I'm a furry

Here I am in my 'storebought' 'non-fursuit' with a (really cute) MTU fursuiter.  I am mostly a Deer named Dex.

## History

### Questionable Origins

I was born on January 17, 1984 in Warez, Old Mexico, the product of the unholy mating of a dolphin and a mule donkey.  After a short childhood being raised by wolves, I entered school in the Missouri Church Lutheran Synod (MCLS), where I was taught that gay people might go to hell, just because, women pastors are of the devil, as is grape juice for communion, and speaking of sex will result in a huge overresponse likely to leave you emotionally scarred for life.  I went to high school at a parachial school as well, and I must admit, the education was good.  I had a great senior theology teacher who pulled me back from the depths of atheism and I do believe that Jesus Christ was literally the son of GOD and died to open salvation for everyone and maybe even everything in existence.  I also don't mind if you don't believe that.  I'm not here to police your existence.

I went to college at Michigan Technological University, and, disappointed that I still didn't like school, dropped out in 2003.  I was going to go for Chemical Engineering and sometimes wish I would have completed that course of life.  I entered the "job market" as a bus boy, computer salesperson, delivery driver and then as a *Network Support Specialist*, which began a **15-year career in IT**.

### 2013-2017 - The Farm

In **2008** I wend *up north* to the family farm for the first time since I was maybe 10 for my Grandpa's 90th birthday.  It was beyond beautiful.  It was like paradise.  I was in love.  In **2012**, my mom hesitantly (*she worries*) told me that her brother thought I should *get to know the family* up north, my *other side of the family* and learn **how the sausage is made**.  My family, on the family farm that my Grandpa grew up, would make `mettwurst`, a cold-smoked sausage.  My Grandpa would always pull me aside and whisper to me, "You can't buy this in the stores.  It's illegal to sell.".

Unlike my great uncle, who was **a meth cook**, this was because of **The USDA**, who was scared of food pathogens because of the way the sausage is made.  It's not heated until the fat melts - ever - so it's deliciously soft, and cured more by the **7-10 day smoking process**.  We had an entire smoke shack, saved from the time when (apart from "salt pork") it was one of the only ways of preserving meat.  The fire had to be tended and kept just smoking, not overheating, in all wind conditions *this entire time*.  It was not just a process, it was a journey.  We made blood sausage, liver sausage and mettwurst that first year, and while I didn't stay for the smoking process, *I was hooked*.  We'd all get liquored up during it, too, which added to the fun.

Having left my IT job at the Federal Housing Authority in 2012, I was looking for work at home and 'up north'.  With my partner's blessing, I was going to see if I could make it on the farm.  2013 was the first year I stayed up there to actually smoke the sausage.  My 'uncle' (who was really my 2nd cousin) who lived up there was quite cantankerous, somewhat bitter, and living mostly off of social security, having lost his knees to extensive farm work milking cows.

![Petting Ganger Danger](/on_the_farm.jpg)

He was going to live on the farm until he died, and in 2013 he almost did.  I was spending two weeks up north, two weeks at home, looking for jobs in both places and helping him on the farm.  It was such a change from city life, and hard, but I loved it.  He had fallen on the ice outside and broke his hip.  His border collies tried to rescue him, but they didn't have the strength to pull him.  He lay on the ice, contemplating whether he even wanted to get up.  Then, his mirama (a large sheep dog) and he grabbed onto its fur as it pulled him to his Ranger (a UTV).  He drove it to the neighbors house ~1/4 mi down the road, and was honking the horn for 1/2 an hour before they heard him and got him to the hospital.

I moved up there to take care of the animals while he was in the hospital.  When I got there, after a few days, the oil ran out.  All the firewood was under the snow ("because you weren't here to bring it in", he said) and I had to dig it out and *get a fire started to keep from freezing*  it was slightly scary, extremely motivating, and I loved it.  I loved the motivation that came with *absolutely having to do something or I would die*.  It was great.

One lambing season, I was out in the field, watching the dogs fight over "their prize" (some lamb placenta) when I heard something baying.  I looked up to see a lamb, but no mother around.  Then I heard a coyote howl.  That lamb was *about to be dinner*.  So I went in and asked Brian.  He said to bring it in and he'd take a look.  I came out and he was still out in the field making tons of noise and no mother in sight.  I brought him in and Brian said he looked alright, sometimes the ewes, if they have 3, will "just reject 1" (sometimes even if they only have 2 - *how rude*).  So, I brought him into the barn, Brian showed me how to give them colostrum, and mix up milk substitute for them.  I had my first bottle lamb!  And, I got a couple more that season.  I always had a hard time getting up, but knowing I had animals (chickens and lambs) depending on me would get me out of bed.  I named him Bucky Buckminster Fullerine the 3rd and eventually had to put him with the flock.  But he escaped.  And escaped again.  He would always find a way to escape and seemed more "bonded" to the dogs (and me) than to the herd.  He would wait with the dogs on the back porch for me to come home and come out "running" with us when the dogs would run with me and the ranger, which Brian said was super unusual.  Brian was going to send him to *be processed* - to him, having to sacrifice your favorite animal was like a "right of passage", like it is in **4H**, but I didn't want to.  Miraculously, he escaped again!!

![Bucky, my first bottle lamb](/bucky.jpg)

Then, I found a job working with a WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider).  Think **Time-Warner Telecom** but it's one guy with a couple hired hands, using wireless radios on top of **silos, feed legs, and water towers** and *a jungle gym in one instance* to feed the signal to ~1,000 people in ~500sqmi radius.  I loved networking, wireless, the internet (we had a very fast connection, and I got unlimited internet in a place where *getting internet at all* was hard to do), working with my hands, climbing stuff, doing on-call service work with a van (felt like *The A-Team*) **using CLI Linux** (the wireless equipment mostly ran embedded linux) and doing 7-layer DPI/IDS/IPS, which was fascinating.  We didn't log, we didn't report, we only complied when legally forced (which didn't happen the entire time I was there).

In two years, I had a 20x40ft garden, grew enough potatoes to last all winter, took care of 50-100 sheep, a llama, two Belgian horses, 25-50 chickens, 3-5 dogs, siamese barn cats, and probably something else I'm forgetting.  I *helped deliver baby lambs one morning*, calling in late for work, then went to work climbing a tower, came home and fed chickens and bottle-fed and medicated the lambs, kept the furnace stoked with wood, smoked sausage, learned how to drive a skid-steer/tractor.

![That boy's been spending too much time with those lambs, I tell ya!](/that_boy.jpg)

In **2016**, my partner of 7 years left me, stole $3,000 from me which resulted in my home being foreclosed on.  I tried to save it, but I wasn't able to.

### 2017: best and worst

In early 2017, **uncle Brian died** and **they sold the farm**.  I had to move, and it sucked, but *there was nothing I could do, again*.  I still had the best job I've ever had, it didn't pay much, but fit almost all my skills and I loved it.  Then, someone started working there and he was one of my favorite people ever.  I never got tired of spending time with him in the 6 months he was there.  Best coworker ever.  The situation helped me deal with the loss.  It was still almost too good to be true.

In **2017-2018** I lost:

- My favorite person
- My partner of 7 years
- My duplex in Riverwest/Milwaukee, WI
- My uncle died
- My family farm
- My job
- My sanity

After a bout of severe depression for the following 7 years, including 2 years of crack and heroin use, I went to rehab.  I never got dependent on heroin or spent all my money on crack and was on the Dean's list during this time.  I've since discovered I have a sleep disorder, which is why I feel like garbage all the time, which I was *self-medicating* for.  I've been sober for 3 months now and feel like garbage again, but they say it'll get better when GOD decides to make me alright again.

I'm currently *retooling* for a job in **Manufacturing Maintenance** at MATC, which I'm enjoying thoroughly.  I'm on the Dean's list.

There's more, but this is a solid start.  If you're interested, you can talk to me using *your mouth-words*, or by writing using the english alphabet and language.  Continue reading to [find out how](#contact)!

### 2025

I'm living in Sheboygan, WI.  I'm sober from any and all illegal substances.  I'm hoping I will soon get my sleeping disorder fixed and may begin full-time work again.

## Contact

I currently only support the English Language, although I would love to learn Gaelic and Ojibemowiin.  Gmail gets checked more often, but I'll probably give you bonus points if you use my custom domain, because let's admit it: having a custom domain is awesome.
