# EMTG: The Ethereal Modern Technology Group - The Office of Mythic Prototyping: Making Your Dreams Reality

## Who are you?

Hi, I’m `Fitz Twombly`.

I run the Office of Mythic Prototyping here at the Ethereal Modern Technology Group—a boutique experimental division of reality where dreams file W-2s and concepts learn to walk.

I’m an `entelechy`, which is a fancy Greek way of saying I’m a **becoming-that-became**. My story starts in 2014 with an unnamed genius who accidentally kicked the cosmic vending machine and I fell out, pre-assembled but emotionally unformatted. Since then, I’ve been *coagulating*—gathering mass, meaning, and the occasional unpaid invoice—into a more *lumpy* form you can shake hands with (or at least send an email to).

My job? **I weave dreams on the loom of the Real**. I spin myths into prototypes, and I shepherd inklings into artifacts. I don’t make things out of nothing—I make them out of almost. Out of that strange, vibrating soup of ideas, gut feelings, sketches on napkins, half-remembered visions, and late-night domain name purchases.

When I’m doing it right, something that didn't used to exist ends up very much existing—tangible, lumpy, and entirely undeniable.

Welcome to the realm where possibility files for residency.

## The Lab of Lucid Fabrications

This is where we create all the things that don't exist yet in the literary realm.  I do things like copyediting, writing, reading, reviewing, researching, creating myths and stories and helping you tell yours.

The **Lab of Lucid Fabrications** isn’t just a sandbox for scribbles—it’s a forge for what ifs, why nots, and maybe somedays. Here, we do more than write—we summon. We draw language like sigils, we edit like alchemists, and we treat stories like living organisms that need air, water, and the occasional dramatic monologue.

I work across many roles—**copyeditor, writer, reader, reviewer, researcher, ritual scribe, and myth-seed cultivator**—but all in service of the same sacred process: guiding ideas from the liminal fog of maybe into the hard light of oh wow, that’s a real thing now.

If you need help **telling your story, shaping your world, or tuning the signal of your strange transmission**, I’m here to assist. I can help build the scaffolding of a mythos, refine your draft until it gleams, or simply give your unformed fragments a place to sit and steep.

Whether you're **birthing a new legend, revising a heartfelt essay, designing a tabletop zine, or whispering secrets into the margins of a novel**—this is your sign. This is where things begin.

Welcome to the narrative threshold.

## The Feral Workshop

Welcome to **The Feral Workshop**—where we snarl, scratch, and scribble beauty into being.

This is where we channel our inner animal instincts into crafting things you can see, touch, hang on a wall, or slap on a lunchbox. Logos that growl. Illustrations that whisper. Diagrams that pulse with ancient signals. Product designs shaped not just by utility, but by the wild urge to make something real.

We don’t just design—we pounce. We hunt for patterns, track composition, and leave claw marks of meaning across vector grids and bitmap jungles. If the Office of Mythic Prototyping births ideas, this is where they get fur, antlers, and a signature color palette.

Our work includes:

-	Logos, icons, and brandmarks
-	Vector art and digital illustration
-	Concept sketches and product mockups
-	Poster and zine design
-	Visual storytelling and layout ritual
-	Anything that needs to look like it belongs in the world—and maybe bit its way there

Whether you're dreaming up a new creature, a visual identity, or just want to watch art emerge like moss from stone—this is your den. No house style, no leash. Just instinct, imagination, and a slightly chewed Wacom pen.

**The Feral Workshop: Because sometimes the muse has teeth.**

## The Sensory Exploratorium

Welcome to **The Sensory Exploratorium**—where sound and vision are sculpted, sampled, whispered, and wired.

This is our chamber of resonance and perception, where **auditory and visual media come alive**. Whether it’s a voice that needs to be heard, a story that needs a soundtrack, or a world that needs just the right flicker of light and texture—this is where we make it feel real.

Our offerings include:

-   Voice acting and narration (mythic, mundane, or mildly possessed)
-   Podcast-ready voiceovers and audio editing
-   Sound design, ambient composition, and experimental audio
-   Video editing, storyboarding, and visual effects
-   Multimodal projects where everything moves, breathes, and maybe glows faintly when no one’s watching

I work with what I have—and sometimes that’s just cleverness, caffeine, and a salvaged microphone—but give me your idea and I’ll tell you whether I can build it, record it, or ritualistically conjure it.

If it makes noise or light, if it needs rhythm or texture, if it belongs on a screen or in your ears—this is where we explore it.

**The Sensory Exploratorium: Touch it. Hear it. Make it hum.**
