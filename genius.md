MyGenius – Life Support For The Rest Of Us

# What is this?

## Are you really a genius?

According to a psychiatrist who evaluated me when I was 13, yes.  I have an IQ of 141, which places me (barely) in the "genius" category.  I'm not a prick about it, though - no condescension, no "dumb questions", nothing too big or small.

## Can't I "Just Google it"?

## How is this different than using AI?

Benefits:
- 1-5 personalized, human-crafted answers per month
- 1-5 personalized (AI) illustrations per month
- Up to 1 hour of research, synthesis, and formatting per question
- Delivered in your preferred format (phone call, e-mail, bullets, plain text, links, etc.)
- Response within 24–48 hours
- If I can’t answer it, it doesn’t count
- As an added benefit I will document it as a Notion page (must request)

* Support an independent tech/art wizard bringing clarity to chaos *

* 🧠 No ads. No upsell. Just the truth, to the best of my ability. *

Welcome and Thanks For Your Support! I look forward to serving you with the answers you need!  Please be as detailed and clear as possible for the best possible answer.  Details on my website https://jackd.ethertech.org/genius/.

📝 How to Submit Your Requests (and What I Need From You):
🧠 For Questions (MyGenius Tier):

-  Be as clear and specific as possible. Include:
-  Context (what are you trying to do?)
-  What you’ve already tried (if anything)
-  Preferred answer format (quick tip, full explanation, links, bullet points, etc.)
-  Preferred answer type (phone call, e-mail, Notion page)
-  Turnaround: 24–48 hours
-  If I don’t know the answer, I’ll tell you—and it won’t count.
-  This is a one-answer service, not ongoing back-and-forth. (If you want more, I offer upgrades, contact me)

🎨 For Illustrations:
-  SFW only.
-  Tell me:
-   What you’d like drawn (person, creature, object, vibe, etc.)
-   Preferred style (realistic, cartoon, sketch, weird, glowing, etc.)
-   Any pose, expression, background ideas, or color palette
-   Reference images if you have any
-   I’ll confirm with a rough idea before I commit to the final.
-   Revisions: 1 light revision allowed. If you want heavy edits, let’s talk about a second slot.
