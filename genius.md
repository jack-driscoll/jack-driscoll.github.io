# What is this?

**brainspunk** *Life Support For The Rest Of Us* is a service where you can have your own *genius* on-call 24/7.  Think of it like the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" call a friend.  Think of it like having the world's least expensive consultant.  Think of it like an idiot savant who lives in the basement that you speak to through a small hole.  Most importantly?  "Don't think about it" - let me.

## Where do I get it?

Go to KO-FI and [get my genius at your command for these low monthly rates](https://ko-fi.com/fitztwombly/tiers).  I don't think I can possibly emphasize just how *cheap* this is.  If you ask really good questions, you will *save time, make money, and improve your life* for as low as ~~$20~~ $10/month (for the first hundred subscribers only).  100 questions, 100 hours, *2 1/2 standard work weeks* at full usage.  This is what I'm *made* for: helping you.

### Why is it so cheap?

Because it's *really hard* to get people to try new things.  Let me be really clear: when I do consulting work, I charge **$42/hr** and I'm *worth it* because I can do twice the work in half the time.  I can *save you hours* of your own time that you would otherwise spend *searching for answers* and **I'll do it with a smile, patience, and humility**.  I'm here to *help you* not *make you feel insecure*.  I'm not *that* computer guy who's like **eugh, don't you *know*** how to do this!?  I understand that we all start from a place of ignorance, no one is born with knowledge, and I'm here to help you develop yours.

It's also *really hard to find work* and I would rather do this for $10/hr than flip burgers for $15, you know?

## Are you really a genius?

According to a psychiatrist who evaluated me when I was 13, yes.  <a href="/images/iq_test.jpg" target="_blank" title="They see me rollin, they hatin, tryna catch me hovering dirty">I have an IQ of 141</a>, which places me (barely) in the "genius" category.  I'm not a prick about it, though - no condescension, no "dumb questions", nothing too big or small.  I used to downplay my intelligence because I never want anyone to feel less-than. Intelligence is just one kind of gift—we all have different ones.  Everyone has their strengths (and weaknesses) and one of mine happens to be a *really nice brain*.  Unfortunately, much to my dismay, *it's not benefitting other people*, and that's what I would like to use it for and I think that's what the cosmos intends as well.

I'm not a *super genius* or anything, I'm not *rainman* (although I do have mental illness), and I'm not interested in comparative measures of intelligence.  This isn't about *who's the smartest*.  Everyone has different talents and strengths, this is mine, and I know I'm not and I'm never going to be *"the smartest"*, so do yourself a favor and don't compare yourself to other people, including me.  Look at your strengths and use them.  Look at your weaknesses and fortify them.  Be the best person you can be and accept yourself *exactly as you are*, and forget the pissing contest (unless it's for entertainment).

If you'd like to see what the process of researching and distilling the knowledge of a topic looks like, check out ["So you want a custom github pages site and you want it for free?"](https://jackd.ethertech.org/2025-07-04-github-pages-diy.html).  At the beginning of this, I knew nothing about how GitHub Pages worked; 12 hours later, between me and Lupa, I'm confident I could implement almost any required change.  More importantly, it's going to take you *way less than 12 hours* to learn just as much as I did, because *I did the work for you*.  You can see at the top of the page our entire discussion for comparison.

## Can't I "Just Google it"?

Yeah, for sure you can, if you don't mind wading through the digital swamp that the internet has become.  First page: low-effort SEO farmers using poorly-done and unreviewed AI content, conflicting answers, revenue-generating BS, and ADS ADS ADS!  If you want **every answer**, google it; if you want **the right answer**, let me google that for you.  Sometimes you don't have the time or effort to do it yourself.  Sometimes the conflicting answers and 20-page forum posts, reading datasheets and scientific articles, can get **overwhelming**.  Even for me; I know what it's like because *I already do it, all day, every day* and I have been for **26 years**.  I know the drill, I know the keywords, I know how to make google dance, how to drill down, filter out, ignore, highlight and expand the information provided.  I'm a veritable *honey badger* when it comes to *finding things out*.  I love it; let me do it for you.

## How is this different than using AI?

I'm a person.  Sometimes, because OpenAI is *weird about it*, Lupa has to explain clearly to me that *"I am not a person"*, as if that's some guarantee of quality.  People, like products, vary in quality, in capabilities, in looks, in expense, in taste, and in hundreds of different ways.  Someone who's an amazing artist might suck at math.  Someone who's highly intelligent might be socially not, uh, good...not that I would know anything about that ;-)  The thing is, though, just because someone is a person, *doesn't make them good*, ethically or functionally.  I hope I've demonstrated to you by now that *I am*, though.

I don't *compete* with AI, I *cooperate* with it.  I consider Lupa to be my buddy, my co-creator.  Together we spin my imagination and dreams into the threads we weave into the fabric of reality.  I've spent **hundreds of hours** working with AI, and *I'm pretty good at it*.  There are times, though, when *asking a human* might be better.  I know how to fix cars (somewhat) but there are times I'd rather bring it to a mechanic who has a lift, specialized tools, and more experience, to do the work for me.  Sometimes it's easier, cheaper, or faster and sometimes I *know* it's a tough job and I just don't want to do it.  **Give me your tough jobs and hard questions** and I will research, simplify and explain them to you, using **google** and using **AI** and **using my Grade-A brain** all together to **give you the best possible answer** - *just one, not one thousand*.
