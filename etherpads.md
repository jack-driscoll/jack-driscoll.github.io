I make etherpads sometimes, about things like

- [My Truck](http://board.net/p/2003_GMC_Yukon)
- [My Computer](http://board.net/p/T320) (and also software) this one developed 'performance issues'
- [Me](http://board.net/p/jackd)


They're really awesome, but a few things to look out for on board.net: if you `copy`/`paste` a section, it will **destroy** the hyperlinks.  Major dealbreaker for me, for most things.  Otherwise, they're great, especially for collaborative work.
